Lie face down on the hyperextension bench with your hips positioned on the pad. Secure your feet under the footpads. Cross your arms over your chest. Lower your upper body by bending at the waist until it's parallel to the floor. Keep your back straight. Now, raise your torso back to the starting position. Repeat this movement, maintaining a straight back throughout.
