Alright, let's get started with a pull-up. 

1. Stand under the bar and reach up to grab it with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.
2. Hang from the bar with your arms fully extended and your feet off the ground.
3. Engage your core and keep your body straight.
4. Pull your body upward by bending your elbows, bringing your chin above the bar.
5. Keep your elbows close to your body as you pull up.
6. Once your chin is above the bar, pause briefly.
7. Lower yourself back down with control until your arms are fully extended again.
8. Repeat the movement for the duration of the exercise. 

Great job! Keep it up!
